**Secure User Registration Web Application**
>
This project implements a secure user registration system using Flask and Jinja templates. The application features user input validation, error handling, and logging, focusing on preventing common web vulnerabilities. Key security measures like input validation, data sanitization, and error handling are applied to ensure a secure user registration process.

**Features:**
>
Flask-based Web Application: Built using Python's Flask framework and Jinja templates for front-end rendering.
Input Validation: Regular expressions are used to validate user input (e.g., email, phone number) and prevent common security issues like SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).
Error Handling: Implemented secure error messages to prevent sensitive data leakage.
Logging: Integrated Python's logging module to track user interactions and errors, providing an audit trail for security purposes.
Security Focus: Emphasized secure data handling, input sanitization, and familiarization with web application security principles to mitigate vulnerabilities.

**Technologies Used:**
>
Backend: Python, Flask
Frontend: HTML, Jinja Templates
Security: Regular Expressions, Logging
Libraries: Flask, Python's built-in logging module
